In my dissertation I was using IBM Cognos, CRM data and Mosaic Experian data. All of those were made available to me by the City of Edinburgh Council.

I was working from within the Council - I was in a CEC building, using a CEC laptop, with a specially created account just for the purposes of this project. The files created in the process are stored in the Council and they were not available for me to download for reasons like: privacy concerns, license limitations.

In case of any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
